<p>Following up on my “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sylvain-arbaudie_worklifebalance-newyearsameme-2024reflections-activity-7277027059300720640--JU3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">New Year, New Me</a>” post — let’s be real, that whole idea is kinda bs right ? Change doesn’t just magically happen because the calendar flips to January. The idea we can reinvent ourselves overnight is unrealistic, and words without intents (and therefore actions) just sets us up for failure more than anything.

I’m taking a step back to reflect on what worked, what didn’t, and where I want to go from here. It’s not about making a bunch of lofty resolutions I won’t keep — it’s about seriously evaluating my past choices and figuring out my next moves with intention.</p><p>This is why I’ve been a bit quieter than usual. I’m not stepping away from anything, just giving myself the space and time evaluate needs and wants, weigh my options and make decisions that feel right for me. Sometimes you need to slow down to move forward with purpose. I still love y’all dear tech family. Stick around, it ain’t gonna last forever :-)</p><p>PS : if you’re curious about living with intent, i can’t recommend you strong enough to read one of Mr Maxwell books about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4CiS01vzgU">intentional life</a>.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3b0ea150c726" width="1" />
