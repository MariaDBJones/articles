<h3>Personal opinion : Maria what ?</h3><p>One year ago exactly, i did post my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mariadb-so-much-more-than-just-mysql-fork-sylvain-arbaudie-blfpf/">first linkedin article</a> (also available <a href="https://medium.com/@arbaudie.it/mariadb-so-much-more-than-just-a-mysql-fork-2ce98b27ebdb">here</a> on medium or <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mariadb-bien-plus-quun-simple-fork-de-mysql-sylvain-arbaudie-ueinf/">here</a> in french) with the goal of becoming a regular author on subjects such as architecture, data, databases et MariaDB in particular. A few days before, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandroduarte/">Alejandro Duarte</a> was posting about some confence he attended and sspoke at as Developer advocate for MariaDB. While discussing the outcome of such talks, we came to the realisation MariaDB was well known within a restricted circle but widely ignored in the rest of the world, even amongst devs.</p><p>All that despite MariaDB having replaced MySQL in most major linux distributions a while ago !!!</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h8ZI3BvN8tkWkPuZo52glg.png" /></figure><p>I have spend that year, publishing on a regular basis, and, boi was it a reality check !! I was shocked to discover so many people actually thinking only postgreSQL is an open source modern database. It’s a great tool, dont get me wrong but why ?<br />The easy way to explain this would be to blame it on the low level of marketing activity of MariaDB plc those last 10 years. But i dont believe it is the main reason.</p><p>For many years now, MariaDB plc has focused its discourse on taking on Oracle and AWS. And i think this is all wrong. How can one hope and compete against those mastondotes when more than half the IT community has no clue what you are or that you even exists ?</p><p>Also the latest move by the corporation (which i discussed <a href="https://medium.com/@arbaudie.it/personal-opinion-maxscale-license-change-1a16baf93a9e">here</a>) moving away from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Source_License">BSL</a> and open-source at large even if only on one distinct component is not a good sign to me either.</p><p>When you talk about relational database, you only ever hear about Oracle or postgreSQl, occasionnaly MSSQL. Mysql ? MariaDB ? Quite never, and its telling. In the news recently, we heard about two big moves in the world of datas, both involved postgreSQL forks. Migration projects (out of Oracle/MSSQL) are mostly win by postgreSQL despite MariaDB <a href="https://severalnines.com/blog/migration-oracle-database-mariadb-deep-dive/">having all it needs</a> and a massive success with <a href="https://mariadb.com/resources/customer-stories/dbs-bank-oracle-to-mariadb/">DBS Bank</a>. MariaDB is also packed with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wlvmt0TD5xo">great features</a> (which some might not be unique anymore). So why keep pretending the ennemy are AWS, GCP, Oracle and such ?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/839/1*cNWkVst81zDbb7yjsUAgfg.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://db-engines.com/en/ranking/relational+dbms">DB-engines RDBMS ranking june2025</a></figcaption></figure><p>Lets be real here : the competitors to Oracle are up there, MSSQL and postgreSQL. Even SQLite is more widely voted for than MariaDB and it barely beats Access in popularity … Aherm … i mean, MS Access right ?</p><p>So i really think both the <a href="https://mariadb.org">Foundation</a> and the <a href="https://mariadb.com">Corporation</a> should (re)focus on spreading the word of their very existence and MariaDB’s. I am far from a marketing specialist, istill know what i would try and implement :</p><ul><li>choose some champions/advocate/ambassadors/you name it, both internally and externally,</li><li>have those people create educational posts in professional linkedin/facebook/twitter/instagram forums &amp; groups about development, databases and devops putting the focus on MariaDB,</li><li>joint coporation/foundation talks to major dev/devops/IT conferences,</li><li>stop sending only SEs &amp; sales to tech events, as much as i love you guys when you are surrounded by tech leads &amp; CTOs it shows,</li><li>send geeks with the sales, either devs or champions and have them give nerd talks,</li><li>sponsorize champions going to smaller conferences to spread the word,</li><li>sponsorize the champions to run local meetups.</li></ul><p>Maybe all this is just an hallucination of mine, but every time i plunge into the world of meetups and conferences i notice there are dozens every day in Europe and barely 30 a year MariaDB folks seem to attend to. This is clearly not enough to Make MariaDB Great Again !!!</p><p>If you are curious about what MariaDB brings to the table, do not hesitate to <a href="https://arbaudie.it/#kedit_bdnvchxdi">reach out to me</a>, and i’ll happily oblige.</p><p>As a reminder, albeit in french, i have been discussing MariaDB in <a href="https://www.ifttd.io/episodes/maria-db">episode #156 of If This Then Dev</a> podcast. I also have proposed some papers around MariaDB in several conferences during the next 6 monthes. Wish me luck !</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=0829ee0b7c42" width="1" />
