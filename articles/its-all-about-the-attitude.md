<p>My professional journey in an MLM network has been a transformative experience, deepening my understanding of soft skills, personal growth, and leadership. Through this path, I’ve gained valuable insights from figures like Michael Jordan, John Maxwell, Tony Robbins, and Richard Branson. Their teachings on resilience, communication, and intentional leadership have shaped my approach to leadership — one that combines personal growth with practical application in my consulting work.</p><p>This focus on personal growth and leadership has been invaluable in shaping my abilities as a consultant. Developing strong soft skills, like effective communication, active listening, and adaptability, allows me to better understand and meet clients’ needs. The lessons I’ve learned from visionary leaders have taught me how to approach challenges with a solution-oriented mindset and inspire collaboration. Ultimately, this foundation enables me to provide meaningful guidance and build lasting, trust-based relationships with clients.</p><p>This focus on growth and leadership has led me to understand that there are two primary types of leadership: <strong>natural leaders</strong> and <strong>de facto leaders</strong>, each shaped by different strengths and challenges. Natural leaders possess innate qualities, such as charisma, empathy, and visionary thinking, which inspire others to follow them without much effort. Their leadership often feels instinctive and is built on personal traits that draw people in. In contrast, de facto leaders are individuals who are placed in leadership roles due to necessity or circumstance, rather than natural abilities. They may not have the inherent charisma or persuasive qualities of a natural leader, so in order to shine they have to rely on competence, reliability, and the ability to make decisions under pressure. While natural leaders excel at building strong personal connections, de facto leaders can typically focus on strategy and results, earning respect through hard work and expertise. Both types of leadership bring unique strengths to the table, and when combined, they can create a dynamic and effective approach to leadership.</p><p>Regardless of where a leader starts, whether naturally inclined or placed into a leadership position out of necessity, they both have the opportunity to enhance their skills and effectiveness over time. For natural leaders, inherent qualities like charisma and vision can be honed through intentional development, such as refining communication skills and strategic thinking. On the other hand, de facto leaders — who may not initially possess the natural abilities — can acquire essential leadership skills like emotional intelligence, conflict resolution, and motivation through learning and practice. In both cases, leadership is not a fixed trait but a skill set that can be developed over time, allowing any leader to enhance their effectiveness.</p><p>As both natural and de facto leaders refine their skills, they must also focus on embodying key leadership qualities such as exemplarity, vision, and purpose. These qualities help transform skills into impactful leadership. The principle of “walking the talk” is vital for any leader, whether natural or de facto. As John Maxwell’s concept of an <strong>intentional life</strong> emphasizes, leadership is about aligning actions with words. This is echoed in the idea that <strong>“A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.”</strong> Leaders who embody their values build trust and inspire their teams by leading through example, creating a culture of accountability and authenticity that encourages others to follow suit.</p><p>Similarly, effective leadership is deeply rooted in <strong>vision and purpose</strong>, and both natural and de facto leaders must strive to empower their teams with humility. Simon Sinek’s insight, <strong>“Leadership is not about being in charge. It is about taking care of those in your charge,”</strong> reminds leaders that their true purpose is to guide and support others, not just to hold authority. By focusing on the growth and well-being of those they lead, leaders ensure that their vision becomes a shared endeavor, fueled by collaboration and mutual respect. Humility becomes the cornerstone of this leadership style, as leaders work toward a collective success rather than individual gain.</p><p>Empowering others with humility is an essential leadership trait, and to truly embody it, leaders can turn to practical tools such as emotional intelligence and active listening — key methods for creating meaningful, trusting relationships with their teams. Humility in leadership is about recognizing that success is not achieved alone but through the strength and contributions of others. By empowering their teams, leaders foster trust and create an environment where people feel valued and motivated to excel. This aligns with Maxwell’s idea of <strong>living intentionally</strong>, where leaders actively support their team’s growth and ensure everyone has the tools and opportunities to succeed. Empowering others isn’t a sign of weakness, but rather an acknowledgment that the true strength of leadership lies in enabling others to shine. Fortunately, we are not left to navigate these skills alone, as there are tools available to help us develop our own leadership style.</p><p>Emotional intelligence is a critical leadership tool that enables individuals to manage their own emotions and understand the emotions of others, fostering healthier relationships and creating more effective teams. Developing emotional intelligence involves several key components: <strong>self-awareness, self-regulation</strong>, and <strong>empathy. </strong>To develop <strong>self-awareness</strong>, individuals can practice mindfulness, keeping track of their emotional reactions and recognizing patterns in their behavior. Journaling and reflecting on situations that triggered strong emotions can also help build a deeper understanding of one’s emotional triggers. <strong>Self-regulation</strong> involves managing emotions effectively, especially in high-stress or challenging situations. To develop this skill, leaders can practice techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or pausing before responding to ensure they remain calm and thoughtful rather than reactive. <strong>Empathy</strong>, a key component of emotional intelligence, can be developed by actively listening and trying to understand others’ perspectives. Leaders can practice putting themselves in others’ shoes, asking open-ended questions to explore their team members’ feelings and concerns, and offering validation or support when needed. By consistently practicing these components, leaders can significantly enhance their emotional intelligence, leading to better decision-making, stronger relationships, and a more positive organizational culture.</p><p>Active listening is crucial for improving communication and strengthening relationships. The adage <strong>“We have two ears and one mouth, so we can listen twice as much as we speak”</strong> emphasizes the importance of truly listening in leadership. Active listening involves fully focusing on the speaker, understanding their message, and responding thoughtfully. To improve this skill, start by giving your full attention to the speaker, avoiding distractions like phones or multitasking. Make eye contact and use non-verbal cues like nodding or leaning forward to show interest. Ask open-ended questions to clarify the speaker’s message and demonstrate your engagement, and refrain from interrupting or jumping to conclusions too quickly. Summarize or paraphrase what you’ve heard to ensure understanding and show that you’ve been paying attention. Finally, give thoughtful, relevant feedback that reflects an understanding of the speaker’s emotions or perspective. Regularly practicing these techniques helps create deeper connections, foster trust, and improve overall communication.</p><p>Non-verbal communication plays a crucial role in leadership, as it often conveys more than words alone. Leaders can enhance their ability to influence and connect with others by being aware of their body language, facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures. <strong>NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming)</strong> techniques offer practical tools to help leaders understand and use non-verbal cues effectively. One key NLP technique is <strong>mirroring</strong>, where a leader subtly mimics the body language of the person they’re communicating with, which helps build rapport and trust. Another technique is <strong>anchoring</strong>, where a leader associates certain body movements or gestures with a positive state of mind, helping them stay calm and focused in challenging situations. Leaders can also pay attention to <strong>eye contact</strong>, which conveys confidence and attentiveness, or use purposeful pauses in speech to create emphasis and maintain engagement. By becoming more aware of these non-verbal cues and practicing NLP techniques, leaders can improve their ability to communicate, inspire trust, and influence others effectively.</p><p>In conclusion, leadership is intricately tied to personal growth. By incorporating tools such as NLP, Intentional Life, and the Four Toltec Agreements, leaders can enhance their communication, emotional resilience, and decision-making. These personal growth practices provide a solid foundation for leaders to foster trust, inspire collaboration, and drive success — both personally and organizationally.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=e9f623d2d6fb" width="1" />
