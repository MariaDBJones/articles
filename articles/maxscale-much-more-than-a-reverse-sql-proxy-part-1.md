<h3>a comprehensive yet somewhat extensive high-level presentation</h3><p>Ever watched your database catch fire at 2 A.M. on a Sunday?</p><p>Yeah, same. One minute it’s business as usual, the next your primary node decides it’s time to put on a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMkrsP2thmg/">Bastille Day fireworks show</a>. Meanwhile, your replicas are spinning in circles, lagging like it’s 1998. Suddenly that brilliant decision to “delay the failover implementation until next sprint” doesn’t feel so clever anymore. And now you’re knee-deep in logs, trying to piece together what broke this time.</p><p>Welcome to production databases: where everything works… until it absolutely doesn’t.</p><p>Most teams pile on tools — managed services, Kubernetes, Airflow, a fleet of scripts — and pray it holds. But let’s be honest: that’s just setting <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C4Yy6RVqqEy/">stacks of cash on fire</a> to warm up a system held together with duct tape and denial. The real problem? It’s not your app. It’s not even your database. It’s the mess in between — the invisible spaghetti of connections, failovers, and state management tying the two together.</p><p>This is exactly where <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> comes in.</p><p>And yeah, I know. You’ve probably heard someone say, “It’s just a SQL <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/">reverse proxy</a>.” Right. Did they also tell you i’m just another annoying french techie, uh ? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯<br /> No, no, no no, no, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> is soooooo much more than a basic SQL level reverse proxy. Just bear with me on this one !</p><p>First things first, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> is an <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/osi-model-reference-guide-816289">OSI Layer 7 (application layer)</a> reverse proxy that includes a built-in SQL parser. Thanks to this, it understands both the <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/server/reference/clientserver-protocol">MariaDB network protocol</a> <strong>and</strong> the <a href="https://mariadb.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Migration-from-other-databases-to-MariaDB.pdf">MariaDB SQL dialect</a>. At its core, it’s a highly multithreaded, stateless, event-polling engine with an API designed for easy plugin development and integration. While developed by MariaDB plc, it works with both <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/server">MariaDB Entreprise Server</a> and <a href="https://mariadb.org/download/?t=mariadb&amp;p=mariadb&amp;r=11.8.2&amp;os=windows&amp;cpu=x86_64&amp;pkg=msi&amp;mirror=icam#entry-header">MariaDB Community Edition</a>. This is how <a href="https://mariadb.com">MariaDB plc</a> describes it :</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/438/1*Fj8GF1W27omAfvOFSNbJrA.png" /><figcaption>MariaDB plc presentation of Maxscle core architecture</figcaption></figure><p>We can notice that the plugins are organized into five categories: <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-authenticators">authentication</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-protocols">protocols</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors">monitors</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-routers">routers</a>, and <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-filters">filters/logs</a>. This categorization gives us a quick glimpse of what <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale">MaxScale</a> has to offer.</p><p><a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> comes with multiple ways to manage <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-authenticators">authentication</a> for incoming sessions — either elegating it to the backend database or handling it internally using one of the following plugins :</p><p><strong>MariaDBAuth</strong> : Native MySQL/MariaDB auth, <br /><strong>PAMAuth</strong> : External authentitcation via PAM (Linux, LDAP, etc.),<br /><strong>GSSAPIAuth</strong> : Kerberos/GSSAPI-based (e.g., Active Directory),<br /><strong>Ed25519</strong> : Strong modern cryptographic authentication auth with Ed25519 signatures.</p><p>Thanks to its pluggable architecture, MaxScale makes it easy to add/modify authentication schemes and technologies as they evolve.</p><p>One might assume <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> is solely designed to handle MariaDB client-server communication. While that is its obvious primary function, its modular architecture also allows for other <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-protocols">protocols</a> to be integrated such as :</p><p><strong>MariaDB (mariadbprotocol) </strong>Implements the standard MariaDB/MySQL client-server protocol for MaxScale, <br /><strong>CDC Protocol (Change Data Capture) </strong>Handles external change data capture stream consuming <a href="https://avro.apache.org/">AVRO</a> converted binary logs datas,<br /><strong>NoSQL Protocol (nosqlprotocol) </strong>Enables MaxScale to act as a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>-compatible endpoint using MariaDB as the datastore.</p><p>As a side note, a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> protocol plugin has been developed, though it hasn’t been officially released yet — hopefully soon. A <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> protocol plugin used to exist as well, and who knows how many more have been developed but not yet widely spreaded ? aren’t <a href="https://medium.com/@arbaudie.it/personal-opinion-maxscale-license-change-1a16baf93a9e">some versions of MaxScale open-source</a> in the end of the day ?!</p><p>He who talks about high availability understands the importance of monitoring services. That’s exactly the role of <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-monitors">monitor plugins</a>: tracking backend server status, detecting failures, promoting replicas, and enabling automatic failover to ensure service continuity.</p><p><strong>mariadbmon</strong> : classic MariaDB stand-alone and/or replication topology monitoring with optional automatic failover, <br /><strong>galeramon</strong> : specifically designed for galera replication.</p><p>Once again, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a>’s modular design means that a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> monitoring plugin could be developed with ease.</p><p><a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-routers">Routers</a> are the core of <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a>, determining how client queries or sessions are routed to backend servers. Positioned between clients and backends, they apply logic to route traffic according to their specific purpose and configuration :</p><p><strong>readwritesplit</strong> : splits queries by type (writes → primary, reads → replicas) within a session,<br /><strong>readconnroute</strong> : routes sessions to a backend server based on role or load,<br /><strong>schemarouter</strong> : routes queries based on target database/schema name; ideal for sharded or multi-tenant setups,<br /><strong>binlogrouter</strong> : creates a <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log">binary log</a> store and acts as a replication proxy forwarding binlogs to replicas and/or consumers,<br /><strong>kadfkacdc</strong> : streams change events to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> from <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log">MariaDB binlogs</a>,<br /><strong>kafkaimporter</strong> : Imports data from <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> into MariaDB,<br /><strong>avrorouter</strong> : Converts <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log">binary logs</a> to <a href="https://avro.apache.org/">Avro format</a> (deprecated),<br /><strong>mirror</strong> : mirrors queries to multiple servers,<br /><strong>diff</strong> : compares query results &amp; consistency across multiple servers,<br /><strong>cat</strong> : concatenates query results from multiple servers.</p><p>Here we are touching again the essence of <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale">MaxScale</a> : it’s not just about managing sessions between a client and a bunch of servers. These are simply tools — once you understand their capabilities and limitations, you can unleash your creativity to tailor the exact software solution you need.</p><p>Last but not least: <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-filters">filters</a> intercept and modify database traffic. They transform, block, or log queries, providing fine-grained control over your database workload and security :</p><p><strong>binlogfilter</strong> : filters <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/server/server-management/server-monitoring-logs/binary-log">binary log</a> events before replication,<br /><strong>cache</strong> : create a query cache for reads,<br /><strong>commentfilter: f</strong>ilters or blocks queries based on comments,<br /><strong>consistentcriticalreadfilter</strong> : ensures consistent reads for transactions,<br /><strong>hintfilter : a</strong>dds or modifies SQL hints for routing logic,<br /><strong>ldifilter</strong> : allows LOAD DATA INFILE from an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a> compatible storage,<br /><strong>lufilter </strong>: allows writing custom filters in <a href="https://www.lua.org/">Lua</a>,<br /><strong>maskingfilter</strong> : masks datas in query results accroding to a rulebook,<br /><strong>maxrowsfilter</strong> : limits the number of rows returned by queries,<br /><strong>namedserverfilter : r</strong>outes queries to specific backends using regex matching and assigned server names,<br /><strong>optimistictransactionexecutionfilter</strong> : optimizes transaction execution in read heavy environements,<br /><strong>psreusefilter : r</strong>euses prepared statements,<br /><strong>querylogallfilter : l</strong>ogs all SQL queries passing through MaxScale,<br /><strong>regexfilter</strong> : rewrites queries matching regular expressions,<br /><strong>rewritefilter</strong> : rewrites queries using regex patterns,<br /><strong>teefilter </strong>: forwards queries to multiple servers simultaneously,<br /><strong>throttlefilter</strong> : limits query rate (requests per second) to prevent overload,<br /><strong>topfilter</strong> : logs &quot;top&quot; n resource-intensive queries,<br /><strong>workloadcaptureandreplayfilter</strong> : captures, archive and replays workloads passing through Maxscale.</p><p>As you can see, there are lots of ways to tailor <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> to your specific needs.</p><p>On the operational side, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> is easy to configure using a fairly human-friendly <em>.cnf</em> file. It also includes a <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/reference/maxscale-rest-api">REST API</a>, a neat <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/maxscale-management/maxgui">web GUI</a>, and a <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/maxscale-management/administrative-tools-for-mariadb-maxscale-maxctrl">command-line tool</a>, making it simple to integrate into your existing stack—whether for monitoring, deployment, or even dynamic configuration via artifact management. Being stateless, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale">MaxScale</a> is fully compatible with Docker and Kubernetes environments. But let's save that nerdiness for an upcoming story and stick to a high-level overview for now.</p><p>Beyond its operational simplicity, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> delivers real value to leadership teams not just technically, but financially and operationally too. MaxScale delivers on all fronts, helping you <strong>control costs</strong>, <strong>reduce complexity</strong> : no need for expensive managed services, DBaaS or K8s deployments until very late in the scaling process.</p><p><a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> optimizes your existing infrastructure by intelligently distributing query load and protecting your primary database from overload. For teams operating on tight budgets or mid-size workloads, it’s a powerful way to <strong>maximize ROI</strong> while maintaining high availability.</p><p><a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> turns complex tasks — failover management, scaling clusters, traffic routing — into <strong>automated, repeatable processes</strong>. This minimizes human error and frees your infrastructure teams from firefighting, letting them focus on <strong>strategic priorities</strong> where lies the <strong>real value</strong> for the company. Development teams benefit too, no longer worrying about which replica to read from or how to handle write routing, enabling faster feature delivery and fewer bugs.</p><p>Centralize query control, access logging, and data masking within <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale">MaxScale</a> : this unified approach <strong>reduces compliance risk</strong> and audit overhead by replacing fragmented, manual controls with an auditable, manageable system.</p><p>Whether scaling globally, migrating workloads, or moving toward microservices, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale">MaxScale</a> still provides the tools and flexibility to grow confidently — <strong>preventing costly rewrites or downtime</strong>.</p><p>At first glance, <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> isn’t flashy — despite having a surprisingly polished web GUI (next story, I promise!). It’s not AI-powered, and it doesn’t promise machine-learning-driven tuning — at least not yet. What it does offer is something more foundational: <strong>structure and stability</strong>, the two pillars of any resilient infrastructure. For teams using MariaDB — at scale or not — <a href="https://mariadb.com/docs/maxscale/">MaxScale</a> isn’t just another tool. It’s the missing link between application agility and database reliability.</p><p>Now you can’t say you didn’t know. So how about taking that first step toward simplifying, automating, and modernizing your database architecture — without breaking the bank? <a href="https://arbaudie.it"><strong>Reach out</strong></a> — I’ll show you how MaxScale fits in your stack.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=716d3361f4b4" width="1" />
