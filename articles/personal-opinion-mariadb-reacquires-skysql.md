<h3>Personal opinion : MariaDB plc (re)acquires SkySQL</h3><p>Following the news of MariaDB plc (re)acquiring SkySQL announced in the <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/27/mariadb/">Register</a> or <a href="https://techintelpro.com/news/AI/Agentic-AI/mariadb-acquires-skysql-to-enhance-ai-powered-dbaas-solutions">TechIntelPro</a> , i wanted to share my thought about that significant move.</p><p>MariaDB’s decision to bring SkySQL back home is particularly interesting, especially in the context of today’s <strong>AI-driven hype</strong>. SkySQL had originally been spun off in 2023 because it was burning more cash than MariaDB could afford at the time.</p><p>After securing $6.6M in seed funding, SkySQL developed a cloud-native, multi-cloud, AI-powered DBaaS, complete with smart features like SkyCopilot and a <strong>semantic agent</strong> for natural language querying. Now, MariaDB is betting on it to ressucitate its own multi-cloud platform and reposition itself as a serious player in the <strong>AI + DBaaS space</strong>. While this move makes sense from a product roadmap perspective, I still have one question:</p><p><strong>What is the real market size for AI-assisted, agentic query generation?</strong></p><p>Natural language interfaces to data are undeniably appealing. I’ve even thought about building a lightweight one myself, just to get some hands-on experience with LLMs, mind you. But outside of demos and prototypes, is there really an <strong>enterprise-scale demand</strong> for this?</p><p>Most production queries today are generated by software — and certainly not in natural language. Given that, how much value do agentic systems bring beyond surface-level usability? We could envision, for example, an AI-backed sales assistant on eCommerce websites and apps. But while the <strong>cost</strong> picture is pretty clear, would that really deliver meaningful value to customers?</p><p>So my guess is this: SkySQL’s actual real value lies in its <strong>serverless multi-cloud architecture</strong> and <strong>SkyCopilot’s automation</strong> features. And i sure hope some of the questionable tech and business choices that were made back then have been fully adressed by now. The semantic query layer is certainly a great marketing lever and innovation showcase — but it has yet to become a <strong>foundational need.</strong> If this is indeed the strategy, it’s a smart one.</p><p>That said, I’m curious: have you already seen <strong>real-world demand</strong> for natural-language querying in production environments?</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=125181507358" width="1" />
