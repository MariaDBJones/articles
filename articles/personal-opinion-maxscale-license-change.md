<h3>Personal opinion : Maxscale license change</h3><p>I realize i never made a presentation of one of the most advanced database proxy for MariaDB/MySQL : <a href="https://mariadb.com/products/maxscale/">MariaDB Maxscale</a> apart from this <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sylvain-arbaudie_github-mariadbjonesmysqlchk-galera-haproxy-activity-7317906910777626624-nr1c/">short introduction to the war of the 3 proxys</a>.</p><p>Now is not really the time and i will make sure to write an extensive one in the coming weeks. There is still something to discuss around that today : its licensing.</p><p>Some of you may remember in 2016 when <a href="https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/introducing-maxscale-2-0-beta-release/">Maxscale 2.0 has been released under BSL</a> for the first time. Monty explained the reasoning behind such a change extensively on <a href="https://monty-says.blogspot.com/2016/08/applying-business-source-licensing-bsl.html">his blog</a>, and he was a long time advocate of the <a href="https://mariadb.com/bsl-faq-mariadb/">BSL</a>. Yet that license usage came under <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/08/24/monty_interview/">harsh criticism</a> despite the logical reasoning behind it.</p><p>While not being an open-source zealot, i still like what OSS bring to the table. Yet i perfectly understood the reasoning of Monty and fully agreed (i still do) with his words then: “Religion doesn’t put meat on the table.” (unless you are a tele-evangelist in Texas of course). BSL seemed a decently reasonable move to actually bring money to the developpers while keeping the FOSS side of things available, albeit with a delay. I understand FOSS zealots and some companies did not like it, but once again, how many of them would have contributed financially ? Probably not much anyway.</p><p>Fast forward a few years, we are now in 2025. <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-25-01/">Maxscale 25.01</a> has been recently released and it is the occasion of <a href="https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/evaluate-mariadbs-powerful-database-proxy-introducing-maxscale-trial/">another license change</a> switching to a <a href="https://mariadb.com/resources/blog/introducing-mariadb-maxscale-25-01-ga/">closed source commercial license</a> with a <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/maxscale-trial/">free limited trial version</a>.</p><p>I am less of a fan of this one to be honest as the spirit of the BSL seems long gone with that move. And with the notable absence so far of “Maxscale only” offering (afaik), it leaves a void in the Community Server users. Nature abhorring void, i think this will most probably give some traction to <a href="https://proxysql.com/">proxySQL</a> rather than bringing more companies to buy <a href="https://mariadb.com/services/technical-support-services/">MariaDB Entreprise Support</a>. Only time will tell, right ?</p><p>This being said, if your company don’t need the very latest features, here’s a good news : <br /><a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-maxscale-2106-maxscale-2106-about-mariadb-maxscale/">Maxscale 21.06</a> has revert back to GPLv2 one year ago in June 2024 as per <a href="https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/MaxScale/blob/24.02/licenses/LICENSE2106.TXT">its license</a> terms. It is subsequently free of charge. At the MariaDB ServerFest in Berlin back in 2024, Johan Wilkman stated that the Corporation was committed to support the GPL versions for 5 years.</p><p>You will find just below a summary of the implications for the versions from 21.06 to 24.08 who are still under BSL.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/737/1*4uRClkwrwKh9qc5pkpuqog.png" /><figcaption>excerpt of Johan Wikman presentation at MariaDB ServerFest Berlin, September 2024</figcaption></figure><p>As you can see, with Maxscale you are covered until 2032. Until then who knows what will happen right ?</p><p>All this being said MaxScale remains a powerful database proxy solution for optimizing performance and high availability in your MariaDB infrastructures, despite the evolution of its licensing model. Do not hesitate to <a href="https://arbaudie.it/#kedit_bdnvchxdi">reach out to discuss</a> your distributed database architecture needs.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=1a16baf93a9e" width="1" />
