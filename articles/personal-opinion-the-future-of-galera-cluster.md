<h3>Personal opinion : the future of Galera Cluster</h3><p>As you already know, <a href="https://pulse2.com/mariadb-buying-codership-oy-and-its-product-galera-cluster/">MariaDB plc acquired Codership Oy</a>, editor of the Galera clustering solution on 2025, June 1st.</p><p>This acquisition makes a lot of sense given the tight integration of Galera into MariaDB server since MariaDB 10.0 in 2014. <a href="https://medium.com/@arbaudie.it/galera-often-overlooked-still-powerful-31fa6bbabc23">Galera Cluster</a> brings <strong>distributed synchronous multi-master clustering</strong> to MariaDB, which differentiates it from other databases, be they proprietary like Oracle or open-source like PostgreSQL. Unlike Oracle RAC (which requires shared storage and Oracle’s expensive licensing) or PostgreSQL’s streaming replication (which is primarily master-slave), Galera provides true multi-master capability without shared storage dependencies, making MariaDB competitive with other high availability features at a fraction of the cost and/or complexity.</p><p>So, what now ?</p><ul><li>first, Galera is a third party library that is available for <a href="https://mariadb.org/download/">MariaDB Community</a>, <a href="https://www.percona.com/mysql/software">Percona Server for MySQL</a> and Oracle Mysql, even tho Oracle did develop its own version of it called <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/group-replication.html">Mysql group replication</a> or <a href="https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/group-replication.html">InnoDB cluster</a>,</li><li>second, Galera is an <a href="https://github.com/codership/galera">open source software</a> licensed under GPLv2,</li><li>third, Codership also provides an<a href="https://galeracluster.com/galera-cluster-enterprise-edition/"> Entreprise Edition</a> available in MariaDB Entreprise Server (and probably others).</li></ul><p>All this means :</p><ul><li>unlike <a href="https://severalnines.com/blog/overview-mariadb-xpand-formerly-clustrixdb/">Xpand (formerly Clustrix)</a>, Galera won’t disappear,</li><li>unlike <a href="https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-columnstore/">ColumnStore (formerly infiniDB)</a>, it won’t stay put for monthes, even tho it is now alive and kicking in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/allenherrera/">Allen Herrera</a> great hands,</li><li>the community version will stay tightly integrated in the MariaDB Community server,</li><li>Oracle MySQL and Percona Server for MySQL won’t probably be supported anymore,</li><li>also the Entreprise Edition will be heavily developped by the corporation and tightly integrated with the Entreprise Server and Maxscale,</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/montywi/">Monty</a> tells us as much on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/montywi_mariadb-buying-codership-oy-and-its-product-activity-7336490305564696577-dw7U/">Linkedin</a> when announcing the deal.</p><p>All in al that is a great move for MariaDB, both the Foundation and the Corporation as it secures a differentiating piece of technology and the knowledge around it. Even if the owner is now the Corporation, it would not make sense to only develop the Entreprise features. And even so, it still means Galera will be maintained for years and bugs and CVEs will receive the necessary fixes.</p><p>On the personal side of things, i am quite happy with the move. MariaDB is a great product which i like a lot for its open-sourceness, <a href="https://medium.com/@arbaudie.it/you-like-legos-so-do-i-19d53d399ffe">flexibility</a>, and ability to deliver performance even on commodity hardware. I also happen to have been <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sylvain-arbaudie_mariadb-buying-codership-oy-and-its-product-activity-7336725081605218305-ZP25/">working with Galera since 2013</a>, and have been consistently working on the <a href="https://mariadb.com/services/training/">MariaDB Corporation training</a> material from my first meeting with the curriculum team on July 2016 in Milan to my latest collaboration this year with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/catherinetrejo/">Catherine Trejo</a>.</p><p>So :</p><ul><li>if you are a MariaDB and Galera user, the future looks bright, <a href="https://arbaudie.it/#kedit_bdnvchxdi">just call me</a> and i will happily help you getting the most out of your cluster,</li><li>if you are a MariaDB user but not a Galera one yet, <a href="https://arbaudie.it/#kedit_bdnvchxdi">please ask me</a> about it, i’ll teach you about it in depth,</li><li>if you are a Galera user using a different MySQL flavor, now is the good time to consider a migration to MariaDB which <a href="https://arbaudie.it/#kedit_bdnvchxdi">i will happily help you</a> with of course,</li><li>if you are not a Galera, nor a MariaDB user, i cannot urge you enough to actually <a href="https://arbaudie.it/#kedit_bdnvchxdi">have a call with me</a> to disscuss those matters,</li></ul><p>There is no best time than now to go for it ! And you can do it just <a href="https://arbaudie.it/#kpg_156128">&gt;&gt;&gt;here&lt;&lt;&lt;</a></p><p>PS : please, MariaDB plc, bring Xpand back !!!!</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=13827b522387" width="1" />
