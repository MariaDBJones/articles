<p>SQL stands for Structured Query Language, a declarative, standardized programming language (Turing complete, by the way) specifically designed to manage and manipulate data stored in relational databases.</p><p>APIs, or Application Programming Interfaces, are sets of rules, protocols, and tools that enable software systems to exchange data and functionality without exposing the internal workings of each system. This simplifies integration and promotes modular development.</p><h3>Abstraction Layer provided by SQL</h3><p>The declarative nature of SQL means you describe <em>what</em> you want to achieve, not <em>how</em> to do it. In that respect, it enables software to interact with relational databases without needing to expose their internal workings. This allows developers to build modular, engine-agnostic interactions with databases.</p><p>Whether the operation is as simple as retrieving a few rows or as complex as modifying the structure of a massive table, you just tell the system what you want, and it handles the rest — usually in the most efficient way possible. You don’t need to fully understand the intricate details of data structure performance or other caveats to manipulate your data effectively.</p><h3>SQL is an API then ?</h3><p>An API is generally expected to provide the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Simplified Access</strong>: Developers can retrieve and manipulate data using a common language, regardless of the database backend.</li><li><strong>Performance Optimization</strong>: SQL engines optimize queries internally, often providing efficient access to data without requiring manual tuning.</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: SQL supports authentication, authorization, and access control via roles and permissions.</li><li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: SQL is supported by virtually all relational database systems.</li><li><strong>Integration with Other APIs</strong>: SQL can be used alongside REST APIs or other service APIs, often serving as the backend data access layer.</li></ul><p>Given its declarative and engine-agnostic nature, SQL indeed functions as a data manipulation API — and a high-level one at that.</p><h3>Challenges and considerations</h3><p>That said, it’s important not to overlook SQL’s own imperfections. Some of the challenges include:</p><ul><li>Advanced SQL can be complex to write and maintain.</li><li>SQL code generation requires proper sanitization to avoid becoming a significant security risk.</li><li>Pushing SQL beyond its intended scope can introduce overhead due to increased complexity.</li><li>SQL does not define anything related to connections, so you typically need to combine it with other APIs or middleware for purposes like scalability.</li></ul><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Thinking of SQL as a high-level relational data API helps clarify its role in modern software architecture. Before dismissing SQL, consider exploring the many features that have been added over the years. It remains a powerful, versatile tool for managing structured data.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=9a004a007bc9" width="1" />
