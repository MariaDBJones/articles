<p>I came across this umpteenth release from Uncle Bob Martin today: <a href="https://x.com/unclebobmartin/status/1917558113177108537">https://x.com/unclebobmartin/status/1917558113177108537</a></p><p>In his codex of clean architecture, UIs and DBs are plugins that should be interchangeable. Yet now he’s ranting about SQL and RDBMS and talking about using low-level functions to process data. This makes no sense in terms of his architectural ideology, because what is SQL apart from a high-level API that makes the storage engine totally interchangeable? We’ll come back to this in more detail very shortly.</p><p>How could we make an architecture independent of the implementation of its data persistence layer if everyone rewrote the interface in their own way? It would make the “DB” a totally integrated component of the architecture, losing any notion of interoperability, which would go against its historical positioning.</p><p>And let’s not even go into the complexity inherent in this proposal. Writing data persistence management software requires a body of knowledge in algorithms and mathematics that few of us are capable of acquiring.</p><p>Bearing in mind that nobody is going to use an app for very long if the UI/UX is terrible and the data persistence haphazard and underperforming, we might as well leave them to specialists rather than to “architects” who couldn’t care less, could we?</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=ddf8b071b5d6" width="1" />
