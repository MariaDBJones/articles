<p>A more personal story</p><p>The “madeleine de Proust” is a powerful literary and cultural concept that originates from Marcel Proust’s renowned novel “À la recherche du temps perdu” (In Search of Lost Time), specifically from the first volume “Du côté de chez Swann” (Swann’s Way), published in 1913 In this work, Proust describes a pivotal moment where the narrator tastes a madeleine cake dipped in tea, which unexpectedly triggers a flood of childhood memories. This seemingly simple act of tasting a madeleine becomes a profound exploration of involuntary memory, where sensory experiences can suddenly evoke long-forgotten memories and emotions.</p><p>The concept has since transcended its literary origins to become a widely recognized expression in French culture and beyond, used to highlight the intricate connection between our senses and our memories, demonstrating how deeply our past experiences are embedded in our consciousness, often resurfacing in unexpected and emotionally charged ways.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*6pN4D-2r3dUg4-dboRpwuA.jpeg" /><figcaption>A fine afternoon snack : Viennese and chocolate bars</figcaption></figure><p>This afternoon delicacy transports me back to the innocent days of my childhood, when I was blissfully unaware of the world’s complexities and cruelties. When sick and ordered some time off school, I was fortunate to be sent to my grandparents’ home in the countryside, where healing happened rather naturally, limiting the need for medicine and chemistry to the bare minimum. On pleasant days, I would join my grandmother on her grocery trips to the local bakery, where she would occasionally treat me to a soft pain au lait (milk bread) or a delicate viennoise (viennese), always accompanied by a small chocolate bar. Around 4 PM, I would savor these treats with enthusiasm, completely oblivious to the financial sacrifice these simple pleasures represented for my grandparents. Those moments were a tender testament to their love — a love expressed through the simplest of gestures, something i only figured out later in life.</p><p>I will always be grateful and cannot thank my parents and grandparents enough for everything they have done for me. I wouldn’t be the person I am today without their support. It is these small moments that keep me grounded and help deflate any sense of self-importance at times.</p><p>Peace out</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=179f2e2f62e6" width="1" />
