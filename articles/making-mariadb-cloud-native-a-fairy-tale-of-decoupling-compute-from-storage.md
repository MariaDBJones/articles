<h3>making MariaDB cloud native : a (fairy ?) tale of decoupling compute from storage</h3><p>Since my early days with MariaDB, i loved the internal deisgn of the server, especially the link in between execution plan and data retrieval from storage. For thos who dont know, as displayed in the schema below, MariaDB (and MySQL of course) treats storage as plugin. Which means Monty &amp; friends had to think of a standardized way to lookup and fetch datas : they basically created a storage agnostic data retrieval API. This soft decoupling of “SQL” layer and the physical retrieval of datas is such a powerful and elegant solution. And it was introduced 17 years ago already !</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/761/1*dpDhC8qlP8IM6TWY6LLzCw.png" /></figure><p>As i kept learning and growing my devops, cloud native and RDBMS related culture an intuition began to grow : that decoupling could reach another level, creating some opportunities for incredible features. Yet i still lacked bits of knowledge to actually transmute my intuition onto an architectural vision.</p><p>Little did know it would come in 3 waves across 1 year and a half.</p><p>First wave, my discussions with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/spasatanasov/">Spas Atanasov</a>, SRE @MariaDB, organizer of the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/kubernetes-community-days-sofia/">Kubernetes Community Days Sofia</a> both online and live when he came to Paris for the Kubecon 2024 along with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mihail-mihaylov-50718852/">Mihail Mihaylov</a>. He was talking about decoupling compute from storage (so very devops &amp; cloud native way of thinking if you ask me), I told him about my intuition that the Query Execution engine (aka handler) was kinda the point where the work should go if we wanted to make MariaDB more cloud native. But i still lacked something.</p><p>Second wave, while keeping my technical watch upon all things RDBMS, i stumbled upon a postgreSQL project called <a href="https://neon.com/">Neon</a>. Yes, the one that <a href="https://www.databricks.com/">Databricks</a> just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/05/14/databricks-to-buy-open-source-database-startup-neon-for-1b/">bought for $1b</a>. It was all about decoupling compute from storage and having a look at the how to part of the documentation, i was struck. It looked so much like what could be achieved with MariaDB if the handler API was worked upon to become an remotely actionable API. Now my intuition was forged into a conviction. What i did not know was : it should be technically possible, but how deep was the necessary work to achieve such a feature ?</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/708/1*gUtt1tHkYbaHmGl_kI8whw.jpeg" /><figcaption>postgreSQL Neon architecture</figcaption></figure><p>The third and last wave came not long ago when i met for a long afternoon of very interesting chats and nice beers with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/svaroqui/">Stephane Varoqui</a>. Amongst many topics, i opened about that growing conviction. He then proceed to tell me that there are ways ot actually compile MariaDB server without the storage engines. He also told me that i was not the first to have that idea. Given the knowledge and experience of the people who work around MySQL &amp; MariaDB it was hardly a surprise to me. I was still very surprised about this not being really talked given the opportunities ahead and the cloud native lasting hype.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/761/1*6bXAWAIxqia1yquCUfR42w.png" /><figcaption>what a cloud native MariaDB could look like</figcaption></figure><p>So far i mostly heard about Neon, based on postgreSQL having achieved this. But then i remembered few years ago <a href="https://www.alibaba.com/">Alibaba</a> did present at <a href="https://mariadb.com/openworks/sessions-on-demand-2018/">M18</a> a shared storage solution for InnoDB called <a href="https://mariadb.com/openworks/sessions-on-demand/polardb-a-shared-storage-solution-for-innodb/">polarDB</a>. After a while, i remembered how they achieved their goal in the storage layer already, making this solution closer to an <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/19/racad/introduction-to-oracle-rac.html">Oracle RAC</a> than a postgreSQL Neon.</p><p>Soon, i’ll tell another story of where all of this could (have ?) lead !</p><p>In the meantime, do not hesitate to <a href="http://arbaudie.it">reach out to me</a> for any data or architecture related need ! let’s talk and bring you the solution you need.</p><img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=dc967e129b02" width="1" />
