# How to disintguish facts, attributes and relations from bullshit ?
We've seen in me previous post ( who said rant ? ) how to easily normalize database items the right way, but how do we know what's what ? It is crucial to clearly define and differentiate between facts, attributes, and relationships to create an efficient and evolutive design . Hereâ€™s how you can identify each component and filter out unnecessary information. 

### Know the domain
It should make perfect sense that nobody ever created a decent data design on a domain it didn't know beforehand. To gaher that knowledge or learnt he missing bits : collect detailed requirements from stakeholders to understand what data needs to be stored and how it will be used. Without this intimate knowledge, it is impossible to filter out unnecessary information ( aka bullshit ). 

* What is a fact ?  
A fact is a fundamental element or entity that represents a real-world object or concept that you need to store information about. For exemaple customer, product, contract, home are facts. Facts are stored in tables with unique ids.

* What is an attribute ?   
An attribute is an intrinsic, usually immutable property or characteristic that provides more detail about a fact. Attributes describe the various facets of said afact. For exemplae, name, first name, colour, size are attributes. Attributes are stored in columns, each having its own.

* What is a relation ?  
A relation defines how two or more facts  interact with each other within the considered system. For exemplae : possessing, living in, purchasing, using are relations. Relations are stored in table containing the unique ids of the linked facts.

* _Rest is probably useless bulshit_   
Until it becomes usefull, but that's gonna be another discussion ( yeah i'll make a whole post about that. Later ).

  
Ain't it easy (peasy) ? Not that much indeed. Let's now have a look to a method that helps identifying the aforementionned 4 categories ( facts, attributes, relations and bullshit ).

### Use natural language
Natural language descriptions are invaluable in distinguishing attributes from facts and relationships.  
A fact is usually a noun that refers to a core concept of the domain we are modeling. Attributes provide specific details about the previous item (the fact), and natural language helps identify these details through descriptive terms and context. Relations are usually expressed by verbs linking facts between themselves.

Example : 
"Our e-commerce platform needs to manage customers, their orders, and the products they purchase. Customers have personal contact details such as name, first name and brithdate, and unique public ID. Each order includes an order date and can contain multiple products, each with a name and price."

* Facts: 
  - customer, order, product - materialized by different tables having unique ids
* Attributes:
  - Customer: unique public ID, name, first name, birthplace - materialized by one column per attribute in the corresponding table
  - Order: order date  - materialized by one colmun per attribute in the corresponding table
  - Product: name, price  - materialized by one colmun per attribute in the corresponding table
* Relationships:
  - A customer places orders - materliazed by a table linking the unique ids of each of the fact tables it does link.
  - An order contains products - materliazed by a table linking the unique ids of each of the fact tables it does link.
